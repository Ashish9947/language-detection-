# language-detection-
Really fast language detection algorithm using conditional probability, law of total probability and Bayes' rule.  This algorithm uses the frequency of each letter in a corpora of very large text and then uses the relative frequency of each letter in the text to detect the language.  

**Note:** This model only works on languages that use latin alphabets.
